# Scheduling_Algorithms
Scheduling algorithms are techniques used by operating systems to manage the execution of processes by allocating CPU time efficiently. These algorithms optimize performance metrics like turnaround time, waiting time, and CPU utilization based on specific criteria such as priority, arrival time, or burst time.

# Scheduling Algorithms

A **University Project** showcasing the implementation of various **Operating System Scheduling Algorithms**. This system allows users to easily calculate and visualize the execution of processes using popular scheduling algorithms. It's designed to help students and developers understand the working of process scheduling in operating systems.
