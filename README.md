# Scheduling Algorithms

**University Project**:Scheduling algorithms are techniques used by operating systems to manage the execution of processes by allocating CPU time efficiently. These algorithms optimize performance metrics like turnaround time, waiting time, and CPU utilization based on specific criteria such as priority, arrival time, or burst time.A comprehensive simulation of **Operating System Scheduling Algorithms** implemented in Python. This project aims to help students, developers, and enthusiasts understand and visualize the execution of processes using popular scheduling algorithms. It provides an intuitive platform to explore various scheduling techniques used in operating systems.
